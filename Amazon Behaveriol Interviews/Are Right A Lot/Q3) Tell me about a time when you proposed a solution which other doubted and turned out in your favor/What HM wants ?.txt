What is the HM expecting in this answer ? 

This question is designed to see if you:

1. Demonstrate conviction and judgment.

	Can you think independently?

	Do you have the confidence to stand by your idea when others are skeptical?

2. Use data or logic to persuade others.

	How did you make your case?

	Did you do due diligence to validate your approach?

3. Handle disagreement professionally.

	Did you remain respectful and collaborative when others challenged you?

4. Show evidence of good decision-making.

	Was your approach ultimately successful because you were thoughtful, not just stubborn?

5. Exemplify ownership and “Are Right, A Lot.”

“Are Right, A Lot” (an Amazon Leadership Principle) doesn’t mean you are arrogant—it means you have good judgment, are open to new information, and ultimately make correct decisions frequently.
