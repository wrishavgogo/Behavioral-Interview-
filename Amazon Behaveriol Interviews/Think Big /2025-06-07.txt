Think Big 


1. Tell me about your proudest profession achievement 



2. Tell me when you went above and beyond the scope of project 

working on multihop wfs , 
introduced a filter and my architect wanted to have a filter by which i can track that ok , this SIS is rejected for this reason 
, i created a MULTIHOP_DEBUG , 
and while doing that i felt i could introduce multiple debug pointers , 
or various other filters which could help debugging issues faster , 

i completed my dev work and behind the scenes kept writing these debug and introduced 
and that would come in the postman response with the headers , 
Created confluence with the flow so that it becomes easier for them to debug issues 

help was OAR could debug issues them selves
