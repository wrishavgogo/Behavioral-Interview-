Q1) Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time or resources 


What they are expecting 


What they want to hear:
You stayed calm under pressure.

You made smart trade-offs (e.g., speed vs. accuracy, short-term fix vs. long-term solution).

You acted resourcefully—used tools like Grafana, Splunk, past experience, documentation, or cross-team help.

You delivered a working solution, even if not perfect, and ideally with real business impact.

✅ A strong answer will include:
SITUATION: There was a tight deadline / lack of manpower / limited access to infra / missing documentation.

TASK: You were responsible for fixing or delivering something despite the limitation.

ACTION: You used tools, logs, automation, past learning, or smart triaging to get it done.

RESULT: You delivered impact, avoided downtime, reduced latency, made a release, or supported the team.

❌ What to avoid:
Complaining about the lack of resources.

Blaming other teams.

Failing to show initiative or creativity.

Giving a result that sounds like failure without a learning.
