1) Your ability to think critically
Do you question assumptions instead of blindly following?

Can you spot something that doesn’t make sense or could be improved?

They want people who don’t just accept the status quo.

2) Your skill in influencing without authority
Instead of telling people what to do, can you guide them to reconsider?

Are you able to spark reflection and change through inquiry rather than demands?

This shows you have emotional intelligence and can drive change even when you’re not the boss.

3) Your collaboration style
Do you ask questions in a respectful, constructive way?

Do you make others feel defensive or curious?

This tells them whether you are a team player and can navigate sensitive conversations diplomatically.

4) Your ownership and initiative
Do you step up when you notice a problem?

Or do you stay silent and let inefficiencies persist?

They want to see you have a bias for action, even if it’s subtle.

5) Your impact orientation
Did your questions lead to a meaningful improvement (better process, clarity, efficiency, product quality)?
