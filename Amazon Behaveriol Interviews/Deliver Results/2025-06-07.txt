Deliver Results 


Q1) By providing an example tell  me when you had to handle a variety of assignments , Describe the results 



Q2) Give me an example when you were 75% of the way of the project and you had to pivot strategy , how were you able to 
make it into a sucess story ? 

Bundle in frequency reroute of Anjali 


S: Situation
I was working on optimizing the bundling logic for orders, aiming to reduce packaging costs by minimizing the number of packages per order. Initially, I implemented a complex permutation & combination-based algorithm to generate optimal bundles while covering edge cases. We were about 75% complete, but during performance reviews, our director raised concerns about the latency cost of this approach, especially under high traffic, and advised against proceeding.

T: Task
We had to pivot quickly to a more scalable, lower-latency solution â€” without delaying the delivery timeline or compromising too much on bundle accuracy. The challenge was to validate the performance of the new frequency-based bundling algorithm before enabling it.

A: Action
I developed a frequency-based heuristic that used historical order patterns to predict likely bundles, eliminating the need for expensive computation.

To validate the switch, I fetched real-time production requests from today's traffic and created a CSV dataset of these inputs.

I ran these requests through JMeter simulations to compare latency and accuracy between the legacy and frequency-based approach.

I then created a report where I flagged scenarios where the legacy approach still outperformed frequency-based bundling.

The number of such cases was well below a defined threshold, which gave us confidence to proceed.

I also collaborated with QA and SRE teams to monitor the performance via Grafana dashboards post-deployment.

The original logic was kept behind a feature flag for selective fallback.

R: Result
The new bundling logic reduced latency by ~60 ms on average and scaled well during peak loads.

The packaging efficiency remained nearly the same, with negligible business impact from the few missed scenarios.

The solution went live on time, and is now used as the default logic, contributing to faster checkout and lower packaging costs.



Q3) Tell me about a time when you overcame obstacles and delivered results ?
