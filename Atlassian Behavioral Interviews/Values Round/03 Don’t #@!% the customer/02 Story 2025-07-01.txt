Preventing Suboptimal Shipment Consolidation for Customers
Question: How is your mentality user-centred? What trade-offs did you make to put the customer first?

Situation:

We were integrating a new algorithm to enforce customer order consolidation, aiming to reduce the number of shipments a customer would receive. 
One tricky use case involved split inventory—where an item was spread across multiple fulfillment nodes.

Task:

The approach decided by senior engineers and directors was to treat each part of a split inventory as a separate “virtual offer,” and
then pass each of these into the frequency algorithm as if they were individual offers. This meant that each split would be evaluated independently,
potentially resulting in suboptimal consolidation.

Action:

While implementing this, I discovered a specific test case where, using the proposed method, our new algorithm would actually 
lose to the legacy one—meaning customers would receive more shipments, not fewer.
Initially, this was considered an edge case by the leadership team. But I wasn’t satisfied with making that assumption.
I performed additional analysis using our OLAP BigQuery setup and also simulated real-time orders in our simulation environment.
It turned out that this edge case wasn’t rare—we were getting 2 such orders every hour.
I brought this data to the director and highlighted the customer impact. This led to a deeper discussion among the team, 
and eventually, we aligned on a hybrid approach that handled split inventory more gracefully—preserving customer experience without sacrificing
performance.

Result:

With the hybrid approach, we didn’t see any events where the new frequency logic lost to legacy in terms of consolidation.
This meant customers consistently got fewer shipments, improving their delivery experience and reducing shipping complexity.

Learning:

This experience taught me that protecting the customer experience sometimes means respectfully challenging even senior decisions,
especially when backed by data. What might seem like an edge case on paper can have real-world impact at scale.
Being persistent and data-driven helped us avoid rolling out a flawed experience and ensured we stayed true to what mattered most: the customer.
