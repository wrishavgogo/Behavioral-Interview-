 Improving Preferred Day Delivery Experience
Question: How is your mentality user-centred? What trade-offs did you make to put the customer first?

Situation:

I was working on a Walmart Day feature, where customers could choose to have their order delivered on a specific day of the week. 
The initial design used a thread pool executor, and the preferred day feasibility calculation involved complex logic to check delivery options for every day of the week.

Task:

To keep response times within SLA, we were using future.get(200ms) to limit how long the computation could take. 
However, because the logic was computationally intensive, especially for larger carts with multiple items, the computation often timed out. 
As a result, the feature didn’t surface reliably to customers—Splunk metrics showed only a ~33% surface rate on the cart page.

Action:

I recognized this was leading to a poor customer experience—many shoppers simply weren’t even offered the option.
I consulted with my architect and proposed leveraging a data cache to avoid recomputing feasibility for every request. 
This required designing a producer-consumer system to precompute and store preferred day options efficiently.
I took ownership of writing the producer and consumer logic and integrating the changes into the application code.
I also coordinated with QA to perform end-to-end and edge-case testing to ensure the feature worked reliably for all cart sizes.

Result:

Once we deployed this solution to production, the surface rate improved dramatically—from ~33% to ~77%. 
This meant a much larger proportion of customers could actually see and use the feature without experiencing delays or timeouts.

Learning:

Through this experience, I learned that putting the customer first often requires challenging existing technical approaches and proactively identifying bottlenecks that degrade user experience. 
Even when something is technically “working,” if it’s unreliable for the customer, it’s worth taking the extra effort to re-architect and deliver a solution that feels seamless to them.
