2: Proactively Resolving Recurring OOM Issues
Question: When have you advocated to push for change?

Situation:

At Walmart, we ran weekly stress tests to validate system resilience under load. For two consecutive weeks, these tests triggered OutOfMemory exceptions. 
Each time, a P2 ticket was raised and handed over between the IDC and PST on-call rotations without resolution.
This created alert fatigue, wasted engineering time, and left the issue unresolved.

Task:

Although I wasn’t directly responsible for this area, I took the initiative to find the root cause and implement a permanent fix, rather than allowing the problem to keep resurfacing.

Action:

I started by analyzing a heap dump from one of the failed stress tests. I traced the memory spike to a background thread running our frequency-based algorithm that evaluated shipment combinations.
I discovered that a bug had been introduced when handling partial inventory cases: the logic incorrectly used shipment.availableQty instead of shipment.requestedQty. 
This caused the system to create an excessive number of shipment clones — for example, 1000 units available for a 20-unit request generated 50 unnecessary clones — leading to massive memory consumption.
I fixed the logic to cap the clones to match the request quantity, eliminating the object explosion.
Additionally, I correlated this fix to Kafka producer errors caused by the inflated number of log messages. After implementing the change:

Kafka error rates dropped significantly.

Producer lag decreased.

Most importantly, the OOM issues stopped entirely in subsequent stress tests.

Result:

The recurring P2 incident was closed permanently.
On-call engineers no longer got paged for this issue.
Kafka logs became manageable again.
The system became more stable and reliable, saving many hours of reactive firefighting.

Learning:

From this experience, I learned that taking ownership beyond your immediate responsibilities can create a ripple effect across the team. 
By proactively addressing the root cause instead of treating symptoms, I not only resolved the problem but also built trust and credibility with my peers and stakeholders. 
It reinforced that stepping up and driving change is often the fastest path to lasting improvement.
