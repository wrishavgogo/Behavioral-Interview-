Mentoring a New Teammate to Deliver a High-Impact Feature
Question: How do you work with other people?

Situation:

A new team member had recently joined Walmart with about 8 months of experience. He was eager to prove himself by delivering impact on a critical feature but was feeling anxious,
as he hadn’t received a good rating in the previous review cycle. He was tasked with implementing an efficient caching mechanism for cloud configs using a concurrent hashmap 
so that config keys wouldn’t need to be parsed repeatedly from JSON. Additionally, whenever a key was updated on the cloud, all pods would get an incremental Kafka event 
to invalidate the corresponding entry in the cache.

Task:

While he had completed the development work, he was unsure how to approach performance testing and validate the effectiveness of his solution.
He shared his concerns with me privately, expressing that he felt overwhelmed and worried he wouldn’t be able to demonstrate measurable impact.

Action:

I decided to step in and support him because I knew this change had the potential not only to help him build credibility but also to significantly improve our 
team’s metrics around latency and system performance. Since I had been closely working with the simulation team, I knew how to create a production-like test environment to benchmark the changes.
I guided him through setting up realistic load simulations, including batching requests (e.g., 40 requests per batch with 100 batches running concurrently) 
to measure system performance under stress. I also helped him define clear metrics to track improvements in average and p99 response times.
Together, we analyzed the results, prepared a summary, and built a data-driven case to present to the leadership team.

Result:

The performance tests showed a significant improvement, reducing average response times by ~50 ms and improving p99 to around 95 ms.
During peak US traffic, the system performed even better. This gave leadership confidence to approve the change for deployment.
Most importantly, it boosted my teammate’s confidence, as he could clearly demonstrate the impact of his work and felt supported by the team.

Learning:

This experience taught me that helping a teammate succeed not only builds trust and strengthens relationships but 
also benefits the broader team by unlocking improvements that might otherwise be left unexplored.
It reinforced the value of letting go of a “not my work” mindset and staying open to supporting others whenever possible.

✅ How it changed:
I added:

“…because I knew this change had the potential not only to help him build credibility but also to significantly improve our team’s metrics around latency and system performance.”

This makes your motivation both empathetic and strategic.
