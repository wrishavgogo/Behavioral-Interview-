Navigating Cross-Team Dependencies for Node-Level Reservation
Question: How do you work with other people?

Situation:

Early in my time at Walmart, I was tasked with building a feature called node-level reservation. 
The goal was to ensure that during a promise call, whichever fulfillment node was reserved during sourcing remained consistent, reducing EDD errors so that promise dates aligned with sourcing dates.
To deliver this, I needed close collaboration with two upstream teams—Unified Promise and Cart—and two downstream teams.

Task:

My responsibility was to design the feature end-to-end, define the contracts, 
and drive alignment among all stakeholders so the feature could be delivered in time for our upcoming annual event.

Action:

As I engaged with the upstream teams, there was a disagreement over handling split inventory use cases. My proposal was to make reservations on all the nodes involved to ensure accuracy,
but the upstream team was concerned about the complexity and did not have bandwidth to implement additional reservations.
To keep the project moving, I offered to take on the extra ownership of handling multiple-node reservations myself. 
I worked with the product team to discuss the trade-offs and finalize contract changes.
Despite repeated discussions, some upstream and downstream teams remained concerned about scope and timelines, especially given the event deadline.
So, after clear communication and agreement with stakeholders, I adapted the approach: instead of reserving all nodes, 
I implemented a simpler solution to reserve only the first node in a split, which was less accurate but acceptable for launch.

Result:

The feature was successfully delivered in time for the annual event, reducing EDD inconsistencies.
I was able to maintain good working relationships with all teams by clearly communicating constraints and trade-offs, 
and by taking on additional responsibilities to help lighten their load.

Learning:

This experience taught me that collaborating effectively isn’t always about convincing others to adopt your preferred approach.
Sometimes, it’s about listening to everyone’s constraints, adjusting your plan pragmatically, and finding a middle ground that balances quality with timelines.
By stepping up to own the more complex parts and maintaining open communication, I built credibility and trust across teams.
