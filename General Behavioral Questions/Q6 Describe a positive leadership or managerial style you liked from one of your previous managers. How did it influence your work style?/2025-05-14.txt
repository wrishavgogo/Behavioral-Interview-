Mathew's nature of asking questions and not taking things for granted 


Situation:
"One of the most impactful leadership styles I experienced was from a Principal Engineer I worked with. He believed in
 fostering a culture of questioning, encouraging everyone on the team to constantly ask 'why' and 'how.' For example,
 in design discussions, even at the low level, he would ask probing questions like, 'Why are these two variables
 together?' This approach was not just about questioning the design but also about encouraging ownership and curiosity
 in the process."

"He encouraged me to ask a lot of questions, even when I wasn’t familiar with a feature or when I felt unsure about a
 decision. Over time, I incorporated this mindset into my own approach, always looking to understand the reasoning
 behind every design choice and asking questions to clarify and improve the solution."

Task:
"This mindset helped me during a recent project where our team was working on a Pay for Speed option, which involved
 spinning off a separate thread for faster delivery options. I asked the question, 'Should we display the consolidation
 option to the customer if they voluntarily choose the Pay for Speed option?' The consolidation option is designed to
 group items together based on delivery times to reduce the number of packages. I realized that the customer’s delivery
 choice could impact how we approach the grouping of items."

Action:
"My question was well-received by the Principal Engineer, and after some discussion, it led to a much clearer and more
 efficient design. Initially, the product team had planned for a standard approach, but with the question raised, the
 design became more streamlined and simpler. The product discussions also recognized that integrating the consolidation
 option into the Pay for Speed flow could optimize both customer experience and the logistics process, leading to fewer
 packages being sent and a better overall user experience."

Result:
"This experience reinforced the value of asking questions, even when you think you might not have all the answers. It
 led to a solution that not only simplified the design but also allowed us to better align the feature with the
 customer’s needs. My curiosity was appreciated by the Principal Engineer, who acknowledged that after clarification,
 the design became much easier to implement."

"Additionally, the clarification and simplification of the design process led to a significant reduction in sprint
 points. The team was able to cut down the project timeline by almost a month, improving efficiency and allowing us to
 deliver the feature ahead of schedule."

"I’ve carried this approach forward into my own work, especially when tackling complex projects. Whether working on a
 multi-item solution or discussing new feature designs, I actively ask questions to ensure the best decisions are made,
 which leads to clearer, more efficient solutions and a better end product."
