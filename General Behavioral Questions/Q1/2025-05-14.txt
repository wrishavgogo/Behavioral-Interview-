noting down answers which came to my mind during that time 

 Example 1 â€” Reasonable Manager Demand
Use this: Inventory Scoring Development

S: We needed to rebalance inventory across the supply chain to reduce out-of-stock and overstock scenarios.
T: My manager set a clear expectation to collaborate with DS and Inventory teams and deliver a scoring system within 4â€“5 weeks.
A: I drove HLD and LLD, aligned with stakeholders, and implemented the scoring logic with adjustable thresholds.
R: The model shifted sourcing behaviorâ€”overstock from 29.4% â†’ 33.9%, understock dropped by 1.4%, out-of-stock orders down by 2.5%. My managerâ€™s clear guidance and realistic goals enabled this success.

ðŸ“Œ Example 2 â€” Unreasonable Manager Demand
Use this: Netflix Hollow Cache migration

S: We were migrating to Netflix Hollow cache for better memory and performance.
T: The manager wanted it done within 2 weeks â€” but the data volume and lack of documentation made that too aggressive.
A: I raised the concern early, broke the work into safe phases, and created rollback plans. Despite the crunch, I delivered most parts, but flagged a few risks that needed more testing.
R: Final migration took 3 weeks with a 20ms response time gain and 10% fewer GC pauses. Manager later acknowledged my risk mitigation helped avoid a production issue.
