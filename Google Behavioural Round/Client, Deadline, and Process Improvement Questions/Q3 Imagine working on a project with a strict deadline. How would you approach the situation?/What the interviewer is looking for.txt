1. Understand the Scope and Prioritize
First, I make sure I fully understand the requirements and constraints. I work with stakeholders to identify the critical features or deliverables, so I can prioritize tasks based on business impact.

2. Break Down the Work
I break the project into smaller, manageable chunks with clear milestones. This helps in tracking progress and adjusting quickly if anything starts slipping.

3. Collaborate Actively
I keep constant communication with my team—syncing up frequently to ensure alignment. If I'm blocked or if dependencies arise, I raise them early to avoid last-minute surprises.

4. Stay Lean and Avoid Over-Engineering
In deadline-driven scenarios, I focus on delivering value fast. That means I avoid premature optimization and stick to practical, testable solutions. I’m also open to revisiting and improving things post-deadline.

5. Time Management and Focus
I minimize distractions, block time for deep work, and monitor my own productivity. If required, I put in extra effort temporarily to meet the deadline, but not at the cost of quality.

6. Test and Deploy Carefully
Even under time pressure, I make sure to write tests for critical paths and validate integrations to ensure we don’t ship regressions or break something in production.
