Situation :- Our application's regression suite was broken v3 , and at that time i was working with an Architect on the v4 version which was getting ready for search and browse page only , only limited number of people were working on that repo at that time . 

Task :- For the new repo we wanted to build a robust regression approach to ensure proper code merges , MVP was already prepared and I had to make the repo stand alone robust and setup a proper regression system 

Action :- I checked why was the current v3 not a good fit and where was it failing , then I found out regressions were written on a separate repo and hosted on a oneops cluster , which would sometimes run and sometimes not , and was detached from the existing PR build pipeline , 
Discovered and came across Cucumber in which you can write regressions in plain english and write methods and link it to 
the english and link method calls to it 

like this 

@And("latitude {string} and longitude {string}")
    public void theRequestHasLatLong(String lat, String longitude) {
        request.getDestinations()
                .stream()
                .filter(destination -> "0".equals(destination.getDestinationId()))
                .forEach(destination -> {
                    Address address = destination.getAddress();
                    address.setLatitude(Double.parseDouble(lat));
                    address.setLongitude(Double.parseDouble(longitude));
                });
    }

"latitude {string} and longitude {string}" ---> this string will make sure this method is called 

Result :- 
Was able to convert v3 regressions and onboard them as well and currently doing the task of onboarding them on the pipeline 
and shipping them onn kubie jobs 
easier for product to track test cases and handle e2e and also slack integration for report 


Difficulty :- 

explaining people how to onboard cucumber , convincing team that its a good fit for the requirement
linking with slack and the pipeline
